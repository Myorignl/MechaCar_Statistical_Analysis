## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Linear Regresssion Output: This linear model predicts the mpg of the car models listed in the Mercharcar data set provided. Several factors are used to determin the mpg, these included  vehice lenght, weight, ground clearance AWD and poiler angle.

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. The data illustrated clearly shows that the vehicle weight, the AWD and spolier angle are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance 
  - Vehicle weight 
  - Spoiler Angle
  - AWD

3. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? The P.value is 5.35e-11 (5.35 x 10 11) and the adjusted r-squared value is 0.6825
To calculate the slope of the linear model we use formula y = mx+b 
4. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  Answer: Yes there is only a small difference between the r-squared and adjusted r-squared value as seen in the immage below
