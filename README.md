1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle weight 
  - Spoiler Angle

3. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    Answer: The slope of the linear model is concidered to be 0 because the p.value is 5.35p.value grater than 0.5  the ignificance value was set at 0.05
    
4. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  Answer: Yes there is only a small difference between the r-squared and adjusted r-squared value as seen in the immage below
